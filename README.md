# Pizza Sales Data Analysis with SQL & Power BI

Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis project! This repository showcases a complete data analysis pipeline starting from SQL queries for data exploration and transformation, to building a rich and interactive dashboard using Power BI. The objective of this project is to analyze sales data from a fictional pizza store and derive actionable business insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a pizza sales dataset using SQL to answer key business questions such as:

- What is the total revenue generated?
- Which pizzas are most and least popular?
- How do sales vary by pizza size and category?
- What trends exist across days and months?

The final outcome is a Power BI dashboard that visually presents these insights in an easy-to-understand format for stakeholders.

## Objectives

- Practice real-world SQL querying skills on a transactional dataset.
- Create business-focused KPIs and trends using SQL.
- Design a professional and dynamic dashboard using Power BI.
- Understand how data-driven decision making can be implemented in the food & beverage industry.


## Dataset Description

The dataset is a fictional representation of pizza orders made over a certain period. Each record in the dataset represents a pizza order with attributes such as:

| Column Name      | Description                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| order_id         | Unique identifier for each order    |
| order_date       | Date of the order                   |
| pizza_id         | ID for each pizza                   |
| pizza_name       | Name of the pizza                   |
| pizza_category   | Category of pizza (Classic, Veggie, etc.) |
| pizza_size       | Size of pizza (S, M, L, XL, XXL)    |
| quantity         | Number of pizzas ordered            |
| total_price      | Price for that row’s order          |

## SQL Analysis Breakdown

### A. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Revenue
- Average Order Value
- Total Pizzas Sold
- Total Orders
- Average Pizzas Per Order

### B. Sales Trends
- Daily Order Trend (by weekday)
- Monthly Order Trend

### C. Category/Size-Based Analysis
- % of Sales by Pizza Category
- % of Sales by Pizza Size
- Total Quantity Sold by Category

### D. Pizza Performance Rankings
- Top & Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue
- Top & Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity
  Top & Bottom 5 Pizzas by Total Orders

### E. Advanced Filtering
Queries can be filtered using `WHERE` clause based on `pizza_category`, `pizza_size`, or even by specific months or days.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The `.pbit` file contains a pre-built dashboard that allows users to interact with:

- KPI cards for high-level metrics
- Line charts for trend analysis
- Bar/column charts showing performance by category and pizza type
- Filters for category, size, and date

> ⚠️ To use the dashboard:  
> Open `Pizza sales.pbit` in Power BI Desktop → Load your dataset → Refresh → Explore.

## Sample Business Questions Answered

- Which day of the week has the highest number of orders?
- Do larger pizzas contribute more to revenue than smaller ones?
- Which pizza category is most profitable?
- Are there pizzas that should be discontinued based on low sales?
- What is the average number of pizzas per order?

## Tools & Technologies

| Tool            | Purpose                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| SQL Server / MySQL | Data exploration and querying    |
| Power BI     | Dashboard design and visualization   |
| Excel (optional) | Initial data cleaning (if needed)  |

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I strengthened my skills in:

- Writing efficient and business-relevant SQL queries.
- Designing interactive dashboards using Power BI.
- Understanding how to analyze retail sales data.
- Communicating data-driven insights clearly to stakeholders.
